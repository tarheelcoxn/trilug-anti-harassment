This document is a draft and has not yet been adopted as part of the TriLUG bylaws.

TriLUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, country of origin, age, or technical background. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Furthermore, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any TriLUG-sponsored event or service. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from talks, events, mailing lists, IRC channel or other services at the discretion of the Steering Committee or its designate. Our complete anti-harassment policy can be found at:
