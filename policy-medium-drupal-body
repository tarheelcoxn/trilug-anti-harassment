In order to provide a space that is inclusive of all people interested in Linux and other Free and Open Source software, TriLUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, country of origin, or age. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Furthermore, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any TriLUG-sponsored event or service. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from talks, events, mailing lists, IRC channel or other services at the discretion of the Steering Committee or its designate.
