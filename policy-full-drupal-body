This document is a draft and has not yet been adopted as part of the TriLUG bylaws.

In order to provide a space that is inclusive of all people interested in Linux and other Free and Open Source software, TriLUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, country of origin, age, or technical background. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Furthermore, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any TriLUG-sponsored event or service. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from talks, events, mailing lists, IRC channel or other services at the discretion of the Steering Committee or its designate. Our complete anti-harassment policy can be found at:

<a href="http://trilug.org/anti-harassment">http://trilug.org/anti-harassment</a>

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, country of origin, age, or technical background. Harassment also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. It may also include sexual images in public spaces. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors or vendors participating in our regular meetings or similar events and activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, anyone invited to present to an audience should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. If the event is a conference or fair with booths, booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Steering Committee or its designate may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion and/or banning from the event or service. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Steering Committee immediately. Steering Committee members will identify themselves at the beginning of any in-person event, are listed on the website at <a href="http://www.trilug.org/">http://www.trilug.org/</a>, and can be found via IRC by typing "@steering" without the quotes.

Steering Committee members or their designates will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any event. We value your attendance.
